## 📱 Detailed UX Flow Analysis

### Authentication Journey

#### **Current Flow:**
```
Settings Tab → Auth Screen → Sign In/Up → Main App
```

#### **Issues:**
1. **No clear primary CTA** - Three equally weighted options
2. **Missing value proposition** - Features list at bottom, not prominent
3. **No social proof** - No user testimonials or usage stats
4. **Abrupt transition** - No smooth onboarding sequence

#### **Recommended Flow:**
```
Settings Tab → Onboarding Carousel → Focused Auth → Success State → Main App
```

### Sign-Up Process

#### **Current Issues:**
- **Long form** - 5 required fields overwhelming
- **Password complexity** - All requirements shown upfront
- **No progressive validation** - Errors only on submit
- **Terms & conditions** - Buried at bottom

#### **Recommendations:**
- **Multi-step approach** - Break into 2-3 screens

- **Real-time validation** - Immediate feedback
- **Prominent value props** - Remind users why they're signing up

### Settings Experience

#### **Current Issues:**
- **Information overload** - 6+ sections visible
- **Poor discoverability** - Hidden features in collapsed sections
- **Inconsistent interactions** - Mix of toggles, navigation, actions
