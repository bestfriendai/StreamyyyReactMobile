# Streamyyy - React Native Multi-Stream Viewer

A modern React Native application for viewing multiple Twitch streams simultaneously with advanced UI/UX and comprehensive streaming features.

## 🚀 Recent Major Improvements

### Multi-View Experience Overhaul
- **Complete UI/UX redesign** using modern React Native libraries (Moti, React Native Reanimated 3)
- **Fixed critical fullscreen issue** - streams now play simultaneously in grid layout instead of forcing fullscreen
- **Professional multi-stream grid** similar to advanced streaming platforms
- **Enhanced stream controls** with Picture-in-Picture, quality settings, and audio management

### New Components Added

#### 1. **MultiViewGrid** (`components/MultiViewGrid.tsx`)
- Clean, responsive grid layout for multiple streams
- Automatic layout calculation (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or auto-adjust)
- Proper 16:9 aspect ratio maintenance
- Individual stream controls (play/pause, mute/unmute, remove)
- Live viewer count and stream metadata display
- Prevents fullscreen mode while maintaining simultaneous playback

#### 2. **EnhancedStreamViewer** (`components/EnhancedStreamViewer.tsx`)
- Advanced stream viewer with modern UI animations
- Picture-in-Picture mode support
- Enhanced overlay system with stream information
- Improved loading states and error handling
- Favorite stream functionality
- Long-press context menus for advanced options

#### 3. **BlurViewFallback** (`components/BlurViewFallback.tsx`)
- Custom blur effect implementation using LinearGradient
- Replaces unsupported @react-native-community/blur
- Multiple blur types (light, dark, xlight, etc.)
- Configurable blur intensity
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Enhanced Features

#### 🎯 **Multi-Stream Management**
- **Simultaneous Stream Playback**: Watch multiple streams at once without fullscreen interference
- **Smart Audio Control**: Global mute, per-stream audio management, and audio prioritization
- **Dynamic Grid Layouts**: Auto-adjusting grid based on number of active streams
- **Stream Quality Controls**: Per-stream quality selection with network-aware recommendations

#### 🎨 **Modern UI/UX Design**
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Modern blur and transparency effects
- **Smooth Animations**: Using Moti and React Native Reanimated 3
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Enhanced Color Scheme**: Purple gradient theme with improved contrast
- **Interactive Elements**: Haptic feedback and micro-interactions

#### 📊 **Live Data Integration**
- **Real-time Viewer Count**: Shows current number of streamers on Twitch
- **Stream Metadata**: Live viewer counts, game categories, and stream status
- **Connection Quality Indicators**: Network status and streaming quality feedback

#### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- **Fixed WebView Fullscreen Issues**: Constrained iframe dimensions prevent unwanted fullscreen
- **Optimized Performance**: Efficient rendering and memory management
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better loading states and error recovery
- **Accessibility Features**: Clear visual indicators and intuitive controls

### Key Bug Fixes

#### ✅ **Critical Fullscreen Issue Resolution**
- **Problem**: Streams were forcing fullscreen mode, preventing multi-stream viewing
- **Solution**: Updated iframe HTML with `allowfullscreen="false"` and constrained dimensions
- **Impact**: Now supports true simultaneous multi-stream viewing

#### ✅ **Stream Sizing and Positioning**
- **Problem**: Streams displayed as tiny boxes (~80x45px) in wrong positions
- **Solution**: Redesigned grid calculations using available screen space with proper 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Impact**: Streams now display at optimal size for mobile viewing

#### ✅ **BlurView Implementation Error**
- **Problem**: App crashed due to unimplemented @react-native-community/blur
- **Solution**: Created BlurViewFallback using LinearGradient to simulate blur effects
- **Impact**: Stable app with working blur effects across all platforms

### Performance Enhancements

- **Optimized WebView Rendering**: Reduced memory usage and improved loading times
- **Smart Animation Management**: Efficient use of React Native Reanimated
- **Lazy Loading**: Streams load on-demand to reduce initial load time
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timers, animations, and WebView instances

### Developer Experience Improvements

- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety across all new components
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in logging and performance tracking
