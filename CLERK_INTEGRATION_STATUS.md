## 🛠️ Available Tools (No Official CLI Needed)

Since Clerk doesn't have an official CLI, I've created custom tools for you:

### 1. Clerk Helper Script
```bash
# Check your Clerk configuration
node scripts/clerk-helper.js check

# Generate configuration template
node scripts/clerk-helper.js config

# Show usage instructions
node scripts/clerk-helper.js help
```

### 2. Clerk Verification Component
Use the `ClerkVerificationScreen` component to test your integration:
- Real-time status checks
- Environment variable validation
- User information display
- Quick actions (sign out, etc.)

### 3. Enhanced Debug Environment
The updated `debug-env.js` now shows comprehensive environment status.

## 🚀 How to Use Your Clerk Integration

### 1. Start Your App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Authentication Flows
- **Sign Up**: Navigate to sign-up screen and create an account
- **Sign In**: Use email/password or OAuth providers
- **OAuth**: Test Google and Discord sign-in
- **Guest Mode**: Continue without authentication

### 3. Verify Integration
- Add the `ClerkVerificationScreen` to your app for testing
- Check the console for Clerk debug information
- Use the helper script to validate configuration
