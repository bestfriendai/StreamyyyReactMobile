# Changelog

All notable changes to the Streamyyy React Native Multi-Stream Viewer project.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-09 - Multi-View Revolution

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Features Added

#### **Complete Multi-View Overhaul**
- **NEW: MultiViewGrid Component** - Professional multi-stream grid layout
  - Supports 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and auto-adaptive layouts
  - Maintains proper 16:9 aspect ratio for all streams
  - Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes
  - Individual stream controls for each cell

- **NEW: EnhancedStreamViewer Component** - Advanced stream viewing experience
  - Picture-in-Picture mode support
  - Enhanced overlay system with stream metadata
  - Long-press context menus for advanced options
  - Smooth animations and micro-interactions
  - Favorite stream functionality

- **NEW: BlurViewFallback Component** - Custom blur effects
  - Replaces unsupported @react-native-community/blur
  - Multiple blur types (light, dark, xlight, etc.)
  - Configurable blur intensity
  - Cross-platform compatibility using LinearGradient

### ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Fixed Fullscreen Streaming Issue**
- **Problem**: All streams were forcing fullscreen mode, preventing multi-stream viewing
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated iframe HTML with `allowfullscreen="false"`
  - Constrained WebView dimensions to prevent fullscreen attempts
  - Added JavaScript to prevent fullscreen events
- **Impact**: Now supports true simultaneous multi-stream viewing

#### **Fixed Stream Sizing and Positioning**

- **Solution**:
  - Redesigned grid calculations using available screen space
  - Implemented proper 16:9 aspect ratio constraints
  - Fixed margin-based positioning instead of flex gaps
- **Impact**: Streams now display at optimal size for mobile viewing

#### **Fixed BlurView Implementation Error**
- **Problem**: App crashed due to unimplemented @react-native-community/blur
- **Solution**: Created BlurViewFallback using LinearGradient
- **Impact**: Stable app with working blur effects across all platforms

## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0

#### **Updated Components**
If you were using the old multi-view system:

```javascript
// Old (v1.x)
import { StreamViewer } from '@/components/StreamViewer';

// New (v2.0)
import { MultiViewGrid } from '@/components/MultiViewGrid';
// or
import { EnhancedStreamViewer } from '@/components/EnhancedStreamViewer';
```

#### **BlurView Migration**
If you were using @react-native-community/blur:

```javascript
// Old
import { BlurView } from '@react-native-community/blur';

// New
import { BlurViewFallback as BlurView } from '@/components/BlurViewFallback';
```

#### **API Changes**
The Twitch API service now includes new methods:

```javascript
// New methods available
await twitchApi.getTotalLiveStreamers(); // Returns number of live streamers
```
